    **Explanation of Fields:**
    * **`name`**: This is the **unique identifier** for your package, following the reverse-domain name convention (e.g., `com.yourcompany.productname`). This is crucial for UPM.
    * **`version`**: The current version of your package (e.g., `1.0.0`). Follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).
    * **`displayName`**: The human-readable name that appears in the Unity Package Manager window.
    * **`description`**: A brief explanation of what your package does.
    * **`unity`**: The minimum Unity Editor version required for this package. Use the major.minor format (e.g., "2021.3").
    * **`unityRelease`**: (Optional) The specific Unity patch release (e.g., "0f1").
    * **`keywords`**: (Optional) Tags that help users find your package.
    * **`author`**: (Optional) Information about the package author.
    * **`dependencies`**: (Optional) A JSON object listing other UPM packages (official or custom) that your package relies on. **Only include UPM packages here**, not your custom DLL dependencies like `DA.Assets.dll` (since that's already compiled *into* your package structure). For example, if your UI system uses TextMeshPro, you should list `com.unity.textmeshpro` here.

6.  **Create an `asmdef` for your Runtime DLLs (Crucial for DLLs inside UPM):**
    Even though you've pre-compiled your DLLs, Unity's UPM still expects a way to manage them. The simplest way to make your DLLs accessible to other assemblies *within* the Unity project (like `Assembly-CSharp.dll`) is to place a simple `.asmdef` file next to them.

    * Inside your `Runtime` folder (`C:\UnityPackages\com.yourcompany.npui\Runtime\`), create a new text file named `NP.UI.Core.Runtime.asmdef`.

    **`NP.UI.Core.Runtime.asmdef` Content:**

    
    ```json
    {
      "name": "NP.UI.Core.Runtime",
      "references": [
        "DA.Assets" // Reference your DA.Assets assembly here
      ],
      "includePlatforms": [],
      "excludePlatforms": [],
      "allowUnsafeCode": false,
      "overrideReferences": false,
      "precompiledReferences": [],
      "autoReferenced": true,
      "defineConstraints": [],
      "versionDefines": []
    }
    ```
    **Explanation:**
    * **`name`**: This is the internal assembly name for the code within this UPM package's `Runtime` folder.
    * **`references`**: This is where you explicitly list the *other* custom assemblies (DLLs) that this assembly depends on. In this case, `NP.UI.Core.dll` depends on `DA.Assets.dll`, so we list `DA.Assets` here. Unity will ensure `DA.Assets.dll` is also present and correctly referenced.
    * **`autoReferenced`**: Set to `true` so that other assemblies in the consuming project (like `Assembly-CSharp.dll`) automatically get a reference to this `NP.UI.Core.Runtime` assembly.

    * **Important for `DA.Assets.dll`:** If `DA.Assets.dll` is a standalone utility that doesn't depend on `NP.UI.Core.dll`, you might consider putting it in a separate `DA.Assets.Runtime.asmdef` within the same `Runtime` folder, or even in its own UPM package if it's truly independent. For simplicity, if `DA.Assets.dll` is only a dependency of `NP.UI.Core.dll`, having it alongside `NP.UI.Core.dll` and referenced by `NP.UI.Core.Runtime.asmdef` is fine.

### **Step 2: Initialize and Push to Git**

1.  **Initialize Git:** Open your terminal or Git Bash and navigate to your package's root folder:
    `cd C:\UnityPackages\com.yourcompany.npui\`
    `git init`

2.  **Add Files:**
    `git add .`

3.  **Commit Changes:**
    `git commit -m "Initial commit of NP UI System UPM package v1.0.0"`

4.  **Create a Remote Repository:** Go to GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, or your preferred Git hosting service and create a **new, empty repository**. Do *not* initialize it with a README or license file.

5.  **Link to Remote and Push:**
    `git remote add origin <YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL>` (e.g., `https://github.com/YourUsername/com.yourcompany.npui.git`)
    `git push -u origin master` (or `main`, depending on your repository's default branch)

---

### **Step 3: Add the Package to Unity Package Manager**

Now, in any new Unity project where you want to use your UI system:

1.  **Open the Unity Editor.**
2.  Go to `Window > Package Manager`.
3.  In the Package Manager window, click the `+` icon in the top-left corner.
4.  Select `Add package from git URL...`.
5.  Enter the URL of your Git repository.
    * **For the latest version (master/main branch):**
        `https://github.com/YourUsername/com.yourcompany.npui.git`
    * **For a specific version (recommended for stability):**
        `https://github.com/YourUsername/com.yourcompany.npui.git#1.0.0` (where `1.0.0` matches the version in your `package.json`)
    * **For a specific commit or tag:**
        `https://github.com/YourUsername/com.yourcompany.npui.git#<commit_hash_or_tag>`

6.  Click `Add`.

Unity will download the package from your Git repository and install it. Your `NP.UI.Core.dll` and `DA.Assets.dll` will be placed in the project's `Packages` folder (read-only), and their types will become available for use in your project's scripts (provided your main game `.asmdef` references `NP.UI.Core.Runtime`).
